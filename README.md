## Work in Progress for Folia. No Promises.

Minecraft doesn’t factor in network latency when determining a player's actions on the server.
This causes the server to receive outdated information that doesn’t reflect the player's clientside position.
As a result, players take negative velocity when they're on the ground clientside, but not serverside.

This plugin handles knockback as if it were calculated clientside, ensuring that no player is at a disadvantage,
regardless of their own or their opponent’s connection.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does this change put high ping players at a disadvantage?
**It depends on the player.** Some may notice a difference if they're used to relying on high ping to reduce knockback. For others, it could actually be an advantage.

### How does this change benefit high ping players?
**Knockback control.** For example, it will be easier to escape crit chains and punish crit.

### Why was the configurability of ping offset removed?
**It promotes consistency across all servers.** Extensive testing with top players has shown that an offset of 25 provides a balanced experience for everyone.

### How do I change the ping offset?
**You must run a modified build of KnockbackSync.** The variable can be changed inside of the [PlayerData](src/main/java/me/caseload/knockbacksync/manager/PlayerData.java) class.
